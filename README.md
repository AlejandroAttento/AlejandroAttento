# Welcome to my GitHub

Here I have a collection of simple (or more complex) process developed.
They are grouped depending on the handled task, by now all the projects are those which I created for courses, but in the future I will be adding more content.
Please feel free to explore the different projects, and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Currently, some of the projects are explained in Spanish, I will be translating them into English in the future.

For more information please feel free to contact me through my E-mail (alejandro@atten.to) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-daniel-attento/) account.
In LinkedIn you can find also more information about me.
